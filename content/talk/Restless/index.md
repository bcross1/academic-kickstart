abstract:While the famous jump scare uses sudden sounds and images to frighten audiences, this is not the only technique that authors and artists use to reach out to their fright-loving audiences. Many scholars have discussed the “act of doing” in horror video games where the player is forced to take an active role in engaging with the content. Aarseth argues that cybertexts such as hypertexts and adventure games “centers attention on the consumer, or user, of the text, as a more integrated figure than even reader-response theorists would claim” (1). She uses the word “ergodic” to describe the active process and points out that in cybertext, the reader uses “nontrivial effort” “to allow the reader to traverse the text” (Aarseth 1). This paper will argue that online horror stories such as Brian Coldrick’s Behind You and the “Ghost in Masung Tunnel” are a form of ergodic hypertexts.
Brian Coldrick’s work in Behind You, provides a mixture of very short stories, often not even a full sentence, with a moving image. Readers are forced to wait as they scan the page for changes, when the horrors are revealed. This combination provides a gap where the reader must watch the animation and tie it back to the text to create their own readings. Unlike jump scares, which are intended to be sudden but obvious, these animated panels or illustrations are often subtle. The benefit of working within the style of a hypertext is in this structure. As Bolter points out “the supporters for hypertext may even argue that hypertext reflects the nature of the human mind itself —that because we think associatively not linearly, hypertext allows us to write as we think” (42). The visuals and text combine to create a unique experience with the additional component of movement, which still images cannot provide. Hypertexts are noted for the reader’s ability to find information smoothly, but this creates multiple, and often non-linear, pathways to access the same information (Ridi 394). Therefore, not every reader will have the same experience and some may be able to create unique pathways.
The “Ghost in Masung Tunnel” uses the aesthetics of scrolling as a way to combine the “act of doing” to engage readers through online formats. This story is set up so the reader must actively scroll down to see the next panel or section of text, some purposely spaced further apart to draw out this moment, which increases a sense of anxiety as readers are forced to slowly move down the page. Unlike simply turning a page, the scrolling controls the pacing of the progression of the story. To add to the ergodic nature of this story, the reader must begin to hunt for the text as the word placement begins to change. Reading these horror stories as ergodic hypertexts focuses on the readers’ active engagement with the material. Instead of passively turning pages, readers must interact to fill in the gaps between the media and the text to understand the horror within.

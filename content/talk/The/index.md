summary:
abstract: Moreau’s Beast Folk use language in a way that raises the fear of human degeneration. Moreau is able to use science on animals to create the physical mechanisms for speech such as the larynx, but is also able to manipulate the brain to create the necessary structures for speech, previously unique to the human brain. Both Darwin and Chambers cite the combination of the organization of the body and the advanced intelligence of the human brain to create the possibility of speech. Moreau uses vivisection and grafting to re-create these mechanisms, resulting in Beast Folk who can understand and speak English. Moreau disputes Müller’s claim that language is more than the formation of the skull and organization of the brain through his creation of the Beast Folk via surgical alterations. By using Darwin’s theory that the continued use of speech led to the physical and mental changes of humans, the argument can be made that ceasing to use speech would result in the weakening of the structures of speech. After Moreau’s death, the Beast Folk no longer heed the Law and stop speaking. The Beast Folk quickly lose their ability to use language, becoming more animalistic through their silence. Prendick loses his language after the deaths of Moreau and Montgomery and begins to struggle differentiating Beast Folk from humans. Using Darwinian theory regarding degeneration, I argue that The Island of Dr. Moreau addresses the Victorian anxiety regarding the use of language as a definite boundary between human and animal by arguing that language fails to keep the inner animal of humanity at bay. Wells suggests that language may be just a cover for the animalistic tendencies that exist within every human. Language alone does not serve to elevate humanity above the animal world.
